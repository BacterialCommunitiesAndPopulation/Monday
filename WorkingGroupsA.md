##Working group 1

Analyze the data with the tools taught on Monday-Wednesday
Make a 2-3 slide pptx-presentation based your results

Go through your results and think what caused the number of sequence reads to decrease during the analysis workflow. 

Was there more OTUs in some samples? Were they from the same year (not if using Jenni's data)

Did you get more contigs with Pear or Mothur?
