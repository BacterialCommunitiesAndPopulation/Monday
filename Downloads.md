#Software and Database Installation

##Summary

For part A you need to install R-studio on your laptop. Additionally, you will need packages Phyloseq and Vegan on Wednesday.

You will also need to download following files to your CSC user area 

  1. http://www.mothur.org/w/images/9/98/Silva.bacteria.zip
  2. http://www.mothur.org/w/images/b/be/Silva.nr_v123.tgz

Copy them to the folder created on Friday: 

    cd /wrk/yourusername/MCOMPOP/
    wget http://www.mothur.org/w/images/9/98/Silva.bacteria.zip
    wget http://www.mothur.org/w/images/b/be/Silva.nr_v123.tgz
    
You'll need to unpack the files and you're all set.
